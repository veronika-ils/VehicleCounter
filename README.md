# Vehicle Counter Project  

A computer vision project for detecting and counting vehicles in videos, images or live camera streams.  
The system uses **OpenCV** and **CLIP** (and optionally PyQt5 for GUI) to track vehicles crossing a defined line, providing real-time **in/out counts** with visualization.
